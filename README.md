ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mariajpf03, or Maria ğŸ˜ƒ. 
ğŸ“– I'm currently a 3rd year student doing a B.Eng in Biotechnology in Denmark ğŸ§ªğŸ§«.
I only started coding Python about a year ago, so I'm slowly developing my coding skills ğŸ˜….
I created this account to be able to store my codes from previous courses and to help future students who will be needing this later ğŸ¤“.
